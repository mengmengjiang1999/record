  abstract  = {In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) has been one of the most popular technologies that facilitate new interactions among things and humans to enhance the quality of life. With the rapid development of the IoT, Industrial and enterprise IoT are emerging as an attractive solution for processing the IoT applications. On the other hand, due to the guarantee of safety-critical conditions without system failures in smart devices, formal verification approaches are essential to manage and evaluate critical failures and reachable status in these problems. In this paper, a review of the formal verification approaches in the IoT applications is presented to recognize the state-of-the-art mechanisms on this important topic. The formal verification approaches of the IoT environments are compared with each other according to the advantages and limitations.}
